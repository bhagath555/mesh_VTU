# mesh_VTU_matlab
This reposity tries to explain the format of VTU file, and How to write a any geometry information as a VTU file. (Using MATLAB).

Basically, VTU in one of the file format of Visualization toolkit (VTK). It stands for Visualization toolkit of Unstructured_grid. There are other types of Visualization toolkit formats like, structured_points, structured_grid, Ploy_data, and more. Here, I would like to describe the structure of VTU file format in possible detailed manner and implement them in programming languages like MATLAB and Python. This helps in visualizing scientific data in software's like ParaView.

The major sections in VTU format are 

* Point information  section, 
* Cell information region,
* Point data section (Data associated with the points).
* Cell data section (Data associated with cells).
